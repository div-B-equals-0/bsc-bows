Bow shocks from the bright star catalog 

* Data from Bodensteiner:2018a
+ http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/A+A/618/A110
+ There are lots of sources
  + 34 aligned bow shocks
  + 60 unaligned bows
  + 52 centered (some of which look like bows to me)
  + 72 unresolved
  + 37 unclassified
+ Many are B stars
  + Bows are mainly O or B0, but 11 are later, up to B5
* Analysis plan
+ We have spectral types for all stars
  + So we can in principle get luminosities
+ Can we do anything with just the 24 micron fluxes?
  + There might not be Herschel data for 60 micron, so it may be the best we can do
+ Apply the \tau-\eta method as best we can
+ And try doing it based on the 24 micron emissivity as well
